<h3>Better healthy than tasty</h3>
<p>A survey by the technical health insurance company showed that 45 percent of UK make sure that it is healthy when eating - in this survey, "tasty" only made second place.</p>
<p>Ingrid Mühlhäuser, professor at the University of Hamburg, examines medical studies for their intrinsic value. "The problem with all nutritional studies is methodology. A pharmaceutical study is blinded and placebo-controlled. But you know what you have eaten. Most of the time, the only question asked is what was eaten. The only really good study, with a large number of participants and over Eight years has shown that it did not matter how the subjects were fed: cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes - all the same.</p>
